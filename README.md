# run_analysis
Coursera: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The code was run from my laptop for which I had to create a separate directory quiz3data for this purpose. I downloaded all data into this directory and unzipped them later.

1) The Codebook.md describes the steps 
2) The run_analysis.R describes the code with comments
2) The final_data.txt file is the final average for all values by subject and activity
